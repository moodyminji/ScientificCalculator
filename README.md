# ScientificCalculator

A command-line scientific calculator written in Java.  
It supports a wide range of operations including basic arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithmic functions, and rounding tools — all within a single class.

## 📦 Features

- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Scientific operations: square root, power, sine, cosine, tangent
- Logarithmic functions: natural log (ln), base-10 log
- Utility methods: round, ceil, floor, min, max, absolute value
- Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero, negative square roots)
- Clean menu-driven interface using a `while` loop and `switch` statement

# 📘 The Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming
**Author:** Mohammed Al Manji

## 🧠 Overview
This paper explores the foundational principles and evolving methodologies of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It covers core concepts including encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, followed by real-world applications. The discussion extends to specialized topics such as component-oriented assembly, reflective invocation, and concurrent object manipulation, offering a comprehensive understanding of OOP’s enduring significance and adaptability in dynamic technical and organizational contexts.

## 🧱 The Core Concepts of OOP

### 🔐 Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the fusion of behavior-driven logic with data-centric representation into a unified entity called an object. The object's internal state is hidden and accessible only through its public interface. This promotes modularity, security, and integrity.  
_Example:_ The method `getBalance()` allows external access to a bank account balance without exposing internal data variables.

### 🎭 Abstraction
Abstraction conceals complex internal processes and exposes only essential features. Interfaces, abstract classes, and method signatures simplify interaction with systems.  
_Example:_ A programmer can use `print()` without understanding the underlying printer driver implementation.

### 👨‍👦 Inheritance
Inheritance allows a subclass to acquire attributes and methods from a superclass. It fosters code reuse and supports hierarchical "is-a" relationships.  
_Single and multiple inheritance_ are handled differently across languages and can affect message propagation and system design.

### 🧬 Polymorphism
Polymorphism refers to an object’s ability to respond differently to the same method call. It includes:  
- **Method Overloading** (compile-time polymorphism)  
- **Method Overriding** (runtime polymorphism)  
_Example:_ `draw()` behaves differently for `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` classes.

## 💡 What Is OOP?

OOP defines software around **self-contained units called objects** that encapsulate both data (state) and logic (behavior). These objects are instantiated from **classes**, which define common structures and actions.  
**Inheritance** simplifies and promotes reuse by letting classes inherit and extend behavior from others, enabling modular and flexible representations of real-world entities.

## 🎯 Goals of OOP

- Promote **code reusability** through modular components  
- Enhance **scalability** and **team-driven development**  
- Support **domain-specific modeling** of real-world systems  
- Facilitate **capital-efficient software technology** by minimizing redundancy and easing system evolution

## 📜 Origins and Evolution

OOP evolved from procedural paradigms such as FORTRAN and ALGOL and gained traction through Simula and Smalltalk. These early languages introduced concepts like inheritance, data abstraction, and concurrency.  
Over time, OOP became a natural progression from procedural designs, favoring readable, modifiable, and rich program structures.

## 🔄 Paradigms and Design Alternatives

### 🧩 Paradigms of OOP
- **Structural:** Programs as networks of interacting objects  
- **Behavioral:** Objects respond to messages and manage internal state  
- **Classification:** Objects grouped into hierarchies via inheritance

### ⚙️ Object Types
- **Functional Objects:** Stateless and computation-focused  
- **Imperative Objects:** Maintain mutable state—traditional OOP core  
- **Active Objects:** Manage concurrency and asynchronous messaging
